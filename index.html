 <h1 style="color:#FFC0CB;">How To Draw a Head</h1>
<!-- Used the <p> tag and custom color for intro, three paragraphs, and conclusion -->
 <p style="color:#EBADD6;">For this assignment, I'm going to tell you how <i>I</i> draw the basic shape of a head. It's fairly simple, and once you learn the basics, you can adjust the shape of the facial features how you want to make fun and interesting new characters! </p>
 <p style="color:#EBADD6;">Now, like I said, this is my way of drawing a face/head, and I know the directions will get kind of lengthy. It's hard to describe how to draw without any visuals. </p>
 <!-- <a> tag used for video -->
 <p style="color:#EBADD6;">To help with that, here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/dJPbju_1jEA" target="_blank" style="color:#DA70D6;">video</a> that does a great job on showing how to draw a face!</p>
 <!-- used <b> tag for bold text -->
 <p style="color:#EBADD6;">With that, I leave you to follow my directions carefully, and <b>hope you have a fun time drawing!</b></p>

  <!-- Unordered list using <ul> and <li> -->
  <ul style="color:#B49CF1""list-style-type:square">
    <li>First, draw a circle. Easy enough!</li>
    <li>Then draw a straight line down the center of that circle.</li>
    <li>Following the edges of the circle downward, create the jaw.</li>
    <li>About a third of the way down is where you shift your pencil diagonally to the right, then straight across, then back up to the other side to make the chin. </li>
    <li>Then, a little above halfway up the midle line, draw a horizontal line. That's where the eyes will go.</li>
    <li>In the middle of each side of that new line, draw a full circle as guides.</li>
    <li>Where the verticle and horizontal lines meet, sketch a long diamond shape for the nose.</li>
    <li>For the mouth, find the middle of the eye circles and draw lines under as guides for the mouth. Make sure to stop at a reasonable place for it to be proportional.</li>
    <li>Going back to the eyes, you want to start at the bottom edge of the circle and draw an almond-ish shape. Eyes aren't perfectly horizontal, so make sure your curves stop at about the middle of the other end of the circle.</li>
    <li>Don't forget eyebrows! Brows aren't just one solid line, so the way I do them is drawing the outline and then fill in with small strokes of my pecil.</li>
    <li>To add details for the nose, you might want to look at an actual nose. Go in the mirror, look one up online. Make small upward curves for the nostrils, and move your pencil around them for the outside of the nostrils.</li>
    <li>Mouths have a few little curves to them, and vary on the person. I recommend looking at pictures of mouths too.</li>
    <li>If you're drawing ears, they start at the eyes and end at the nose if it's straight on. They have some slight curves to them, too. But if the hair you draw covers them, you don't have to really worry about them.</li>
    <li>Next is the hairline. Start about the middle of the ear and curve upwards and follow the curve of the head.</li>
    <li>For the actual hair, find where you want the part, and use that to help where you want it the flow. There are many different types of hair, so, again, use reference. I can't stress that enough. </li>
    <li>At the end, so you don't have a floating head, make the neck and shoulders. I'm still learning where the neck should start myself, but where I usually start is the center of each half of the head.</li>
    <li>The shoulders have a slight bump to them where some muscle is, so they don't exactly follow a straight line. Move in a slight diagonal downward motion for the rest.</li>
   <!-- Used <p> for conclusion -->
    <p>There! Now you've made a basic head! It doesn't have to be perfectly real, so don't worry. My style isn't realism, but it's good to have the basics down first.</p>
